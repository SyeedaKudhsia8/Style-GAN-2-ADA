# Style-GAN-2-ADA

This study proposes the use of generative adversarial networks using StyleGAN2-ADA to generate high-quality artificial bridal dress images. As a result of the study, incorporating the new improved version of StyleGAN2 that uses adaptive discriminator augmentation (ADA), on small dataset of approximately 900 images reports the best KID readings. The results that are obtained by using StyleGAN2-ADA yielded a low KID, which improved the performance of the original version of StyleGAN2.
